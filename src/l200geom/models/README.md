- `BasePlate_medium_ortec.stl`, `TopPlate_ppc.stl` and `TopPlates.stl` have been extracted
  from the as-built CAD model of the module assembly (as of October 2022)
- all other `BasePlate_*.stl` are the PEN plates. Source: MaGe
  (`source/legendgeometry/stl_files/`)
  Updated by A. Leonhard, so that the origin in all three coordinates is centered
- `StringSupportStructure.stl` is the support rod for a HPGe string. Source: MaGe
